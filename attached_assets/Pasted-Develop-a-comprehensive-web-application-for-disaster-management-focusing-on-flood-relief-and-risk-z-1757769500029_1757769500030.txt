Develop a comprehensive web application for disaster management, focusing on flood relief and risk zone identification. The app should provide real-time information on flood-affected areas, enable efficient resource allocation, and support district-level disaster management.

Objective: Create a user-friendly and scalable web app that facilitates timely decision-making, optimizes resource distribution, and enhances collaboration among stakeholders.

Key Features:

1.⁠ ⁠Flood Mapping: Integrate geospatial data to create interactive maps that identify flood-prone areas, display flood extent, and provide real-time updates on water levels and flood warnings.
2.⁠ ⁠Relief Distribution: Develop a module for tracking and managing relief distribution, including food, shelter, medical supplies, and other essential resources.
3.⁠ ⁠Affected Population: Create a database to store information on affected people, including their location, needs, and status.
4.⁠ ⁠Resource Allocation: Implement a resource allocation system that optimizes the distribution of resources based on need, availability, and priority.
5.⁠ ⁠District-Level Management: Design a dashboard for district-level authorities to monitor and manage disaster response efforts, including resource allocation, relief distribution, and flood risk assessment.
6.⁠ ⁠Real-time Updates: Integrate APIs for real-time weather updates, water level monitoring, and flood warnings to ensure timely decision-making.
7.⁠ ⁠Collaboration: Develop features for collaboration between stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and local communities.
8.⁠ ⁠Data Analytics: Incorporate data analytics capabilities to provide insights on flood patterns, resource utilization, and relief effectiveness.

Technical Requirements:

1.⁠ ⁠Front-end: Build the web app using a responsive framework (e.g., React, Angular) with interactive maps and visualizations.
2.⁠ ⁠Back-end: Use a robust framework (e.g., Node.js, Django) to manage data, APIs, and business logic.
3.⁠ ⁠Database: Design a database schema to store and manage data on flood-affected areas, relief distribution, and resource allocation.
4.⁠ ⁠APIs: Integrate APIs for geospatial data, weather updates, and other relevant data sources.

Goals:

1.⁠ ⁠Improve response time: Enable timely decision-making and resource allocation to support flood-affected communities.
2.⁠ ⁠Enhance resource utilization: Optimize resource distribution and allocation to maximize impact.
3.⁠ ⁠Support district-level management: Provide district-level authorities with a platform to manage disaster response efforts effectively.

Target Audience:

1.⁠ ⁠District-level authorities: Officials responsible for disaster management and response at the district level.
2.⁠ ⁠Relief organizations: NGOs, government agencies, and other organizations involved in disaster relief efforts.
3.⁠ ⁠Affected communities: People living in flood-prone areas who can benefit from timely relief and support.

Deliverables:

1.⁠ ⁠Fully functional web app: A comprehensive web application that meets the requirements and objectives outlined above.
2.⁠ ⁠Documentation: Detailed documentation on the app's features, functionality, and technical requirements.
3.⁠ ⁠Training and support: Provide training and support for users to ensure effective utilization of the app.

Evaluation Criteria:

1.⁠ ⁠Functionality: The app's ability to meet the requirements and objectives outlined above.
2.⁠ ⁠Usability: The app's user-friendliness, accessibility, and overall user experience.
3.⁠ ⁠Scalability: The app's ability to handle increased traffic and data during disaster events.
4.⁠ ⁠Security: The app's data security measures and protection of sensitive information.
